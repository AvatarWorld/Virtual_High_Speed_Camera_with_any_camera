# Virtual High Speed Camera with any camera


This program implements a virtual high speed camera from a foto or from a video with origin in a normal camera. This is an independent implementation of the concepts and ideas of the paper:

With this code you can expand grayscale fotos of a moving objects into 256 independent binary images, that are joined in a video of the movement that ocurred.<br>
You can also expand frames inside a movie or a movie into a slow motion version.<br>
This high speed camera method only applies to the capture os binary objects, ex: black in a white background or the reverse.
